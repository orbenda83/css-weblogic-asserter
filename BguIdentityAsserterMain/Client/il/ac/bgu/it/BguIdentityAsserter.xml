<!-- Declare your mbean.

     Since it is for an identity asserter, it must extend the
     weblogic.management.security.authentication.IdentityAsserter mbean.

     The Name and DisplayName must be the same.
     They specify the name that will appear on the
     console for this provider.

     Set the PeristPolicy to "OnUpdate" so that if an attribute
     value is changed, the new value is written to disk immediately.
     See the "Developing Security Services" manual for more info.

     Note that since this is an xml document, you can't use double
     quotes directly.  Instead you need to use &quot;

     Note that setting "Writeable" to "false" on an attribute
     makes the attribute read-only.  The default is read-write.

 <!-- You must set the value of the ProviderClassName attribute

      weblogic.security.spi.AuthenticationProvider interface.

      You can think of the provider's mbean as the factory
      for your provider's runtime implementation.
